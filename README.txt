ThumbDJ allows you to queue songs to Grooveshark with a simple text message

I took out our keys in the config file, so you would have to get keys / fill those out

The config file is thumbdj.ini in public_html


(Getting grooveshark keys might be hard, but contact islam if you're really serious about starting this up again... islam.sharabash@gmail.com)
