ThumbDJ allows you to queue songs to Grooveshark with a simple text message

Pretty bad code in here... 
If you want to take over the project (and delete most of the code :p) let islam.sharabash@gmail.com know.

I took out our keys in the config file, so you would have to get keys / fill those out

The config file is thumbdj.ini in public_html


(Getting grooveshark keys might be hard, but contact islam if you're really serious about starting this up again... islam.sharabash@gmail.com)



--- Just realized this doesn't make sense unless you know the db schema

In any case, if you really want try it and work on it, let Islam know, he'll help you get setup...


In the meantime, I think there's still a working version over at hani.thumbdj.com
